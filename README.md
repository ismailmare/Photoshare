# WebDatabaseApp

Database setup needs to be done under each computer i think

Database tables set up in database_dump file

I have used Mamp. There is MAMP for windows as well

Index is the file that will run when localhost page is launched first.



PHPmyAdmin: http://localhost:8888
Webpage: http://localhost:8889

Start Server from MAMP Application
